Smart Email Reply System
Introduction
The Smart Email Reply System is an intelligent application that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to generate email responses. The system uses a machine learning model to analyze the context of the email and generate a reply that is relevant and accurate.

Installation
To run this application, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later installed on your system. You will also need to install the following dependencies:

numpy
pandas
tensorflow
keras
scikit-learn
nltk
You can install these dependencies using pip by running the following command:

How to Use
 - Clone the repository to your local machine:
 - Navigate to the project directory:
 - cd smart-email-reply
 - Install the dependencies:
 - pip install -r requirements.txt
 - Run the application:
 - python app.py

The application will prompt you to enter the email message. After you have entered the message, press Enter to generate the response.
Project Files
IRS_Project.ipynb: This is the main file of the application. It contains the code for the function for generating email responses and model building.
emails.csv: This file contains the email responses of morethan 5Lac +. Get dataset from here - https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset
tokenizer.json: This file contains the tokenizer used to preprocess the input data.
lstm_model.h5: This file contains the trained machine learning model used to generate email responses.
README.md: This file contains information about the project and how to use it.

steps to run the IRS_Project.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook:

Make sure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system. You can install it using pip or conda depending on your environment.

Download the IRS_Project.ipynb file and store it in a directory on your system.

Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the directory where you stored the IRS_Project.ipynb file.

Click on the IRS_Project.ipynb file to open it in Jupyter Notebook.

Before running any cell in the notebook, make sure to install all the required libraries mentioned in the 'Libraries Used' section of the notebook. You can install the libraries using pip or conda depending on your environment.

Once all the libraries are installed, you can run the cells in the notebook in sequential order to execute the code.

To run a cell, click on it to select it and then press Shift + Enter or click on the Run button in the toolbar.

Some cells might take a while to execute, especially the ones where the model is trained. Please be patient and wait for the cell to finish executing before running the next one.

You can also modify the code in the cells if you want to experiment with different configurations or parameters.

Once you have run all the cells in the notebook, you should see the output of the project, which includes the trained model's performance and sample predictions.

Conclusion
The Smart Email Reply System is an innovative application that can save you time and effort when responding to emails. It uses machine learning and NLP techniques to generate accurate and relevant email responses. With its simple user interface and easy installation process, the Smart Email Reply System is a must-have tool for anyone who wants to be more productive in their email communication.
